### Project Title
Explore bike share data in python

### Description
Explore the data related to the bike share system for three major cities in the USA -
Chicao, New York City and Washington

#### Prerequisites:
The following files should be in the same folder as the program:
- "chicago.csv"
- "new_york_city.csv"
- "washington.csv"

#### Starting the program:
`ipython bikeshare.py`

#### Usage:
After starting the program, it will ask you to select:
1. a city, possible values: 
   - Chicago
   - New York City
   - Washington
   
2. a month, possible values:
   - All
   - a specific month from the following list: 
     - January
     - February
     - March
     - April
     - May
     - June
     
3. a day, possible values:
   - All
   - a specific day from the following list:
     - Monday
     - Tuesday
     - Wednesday
     - Thursday
     - Friday
     - Saturday
     - Sunday
     
***Hint***
It is enough to write the first couple of characters, for example:
instead of Chicago just answer c or C, both will be accepted.
Since the months March and May both start with "M", the program
is not able the identify unambigously which month to select, so
in this case type a longer answer, for example Mar for March.
